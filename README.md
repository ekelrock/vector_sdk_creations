**api_joke_test.py** - Have Vector tell you a random Chuck Norris joke from the http://www.icndb.com/ API. Heavily commented to help the community, and myself, understand what's going on. All of the values from the API call are parsed and printed, only the "joke" value is passed to Vector to speak.
